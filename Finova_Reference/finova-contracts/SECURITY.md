## Security Architecture Overview

Finova Network implements a multi-layered security architecture:

### Layer 1: Smart Contract Security
- **Formal Verification**: All critical functions are mathematically proven
- **Multiple Audits**: Minimum 3 independent security audits before deployment
- **Upgrade Safety**: Transparent proxy patterns with timelock mechanisms
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with multi-signature requirements

### Layer 2: Application Security
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication with biometric verification
- **Session Management**: JWT with refresh tokens and automatic expiry
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive sanitization and validation
- **Rate Limiting**: Adaptive rate limiting with DDoS protection

### Layer 3: Infrastructure Security
- **Network Security**: WAF, intrusion detection, and real-time monitoring
- **Data Encryption**: AES-256 for data at rest, TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- **Key Management**: Hardware Security Modules (HSM) for key storage
- **Monitoring**: 24/7 Security Operations Center (SOC)

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Secure Coding**
   - Follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines
   - Use static analysis tools (Clippy, ESLint, etc.)
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Validate all inputs and sanitize outputs

2. **Testing**
   - Write security-focused unit tests
   - Perform integration testing with security scenarios
   - Use fuzzing for smart contracts
   - Conduct regular penetration testing

3. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use tools like `cargo audit` and `npm audit`
   - Prefer well-maintained, audited libraries
