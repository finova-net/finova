This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

* Participating in official Finova Network forums, Discord, or Telegram channels
* Contributing to official repositories and documentation
* Representing Finova Network at conferences or meetups

## Reporting Guidelines

### How to Report

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

* **Email**: conduct@finova.network
* **Discord**: Contact any moderator with the @Moderator role
* **Telegram**: Contact @FinovaSupport
* **Security Issues**: security@finova.network (for technical violations)

### What to Include in Your Report

* **Your contact information** (so we can get in touch with you)
* **Names (usernames, real names)** of any individuals involved
* **When and where the incident occurred**
* **Your account of what happened**
* **Additional context** you believe might be helpful
* **Any supporting evidence** (screenshots, links, etc.)

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. We will not name harassment victims without their consent.

## Enforcement Process

### Investigation Process

1. **Initial Review** (24-48 hours): Community leaders will acknowledge receipt and begin initial assessment
2. **Investigation** (3-7 days): Gathering information from all parties involved
3. **Decision** (1-3 days): Determination of appropriate response based on severity
4. **Implementation**: Enforcement action taken if warranted
5. **Follow-up**: Monitoring and additional action if needed

### Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

#### 1. Warning
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

#### 2. Temporary Suspension
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

#### 3. Permanent Ban
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Special Considerations for Technical Contributors

### Smart Contract Security
* **Responsible disclosure**: Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately to security@finova.network before public disclosure
* **No malicious code**: Contributors must not submit code designed to exploit, harm, or compromise user funds or data
* **Testing requirements**: All smart contract changes must include comprehensive tests and security considerations

### Code Review Standards
* **Constructive feedback**: Code reviews should focus on technical merit and security
* **Educational approach**: Help other contributors learn rather than just pointing out mistakes
* **Security-first mindset**: Always consider potential security implications in reviews

### Open Source Collaboration
* **Attribution**: Properly credit all contributors and acknowledge prior work
* **Licensing compliance**: Respect all open source licenses and intellectual property
* **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation for all contributions

## Appeals Process

If you believe you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of Conduct, you should notify the Finova Network team with a concise description of your grievance. Appeals will be handled by a different set of community leaders than those involved in the original enforcement action.

### Appeals Timeline
* **Initial appeal**: Submit within 30 days of enforcement action
* **Review period**: 7-14 days for investigation
* **Decision**: Final decision communicated within 3 days of review completion
