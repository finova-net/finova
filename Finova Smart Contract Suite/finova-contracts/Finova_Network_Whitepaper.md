Integrated Reward System (XP + RP + $FIN)
Master Formula Architecture
The Finova reward system operates on a three-dimensional matrix where all rewards are interconnected:
Final_Reward = Base_Mining_Rate × XP_Multiplier × RP_Multiplier × Quality_Score × Network_Regression
Where:
•	Base_Mining_Rate: Core $FIN generation (0.001-0.1 $FIN/hour)
•	XP_Multiplier: Experience-based boost (1.0x - 5.0x)
•	RP_Multiplier: Referral network effect (1.0x - 3.0x)
•	Quality_Score: AI-validated engagement quality (0.5x - 2.0x)
•	Network_Regression: Anti-whale exponential decay (1.0 to 0.1)

Mining Mechanism
Pi Network-Inspired Core Mining
Finova implements a sophisticated mining algorithm that balances user growth, referral networks, and token holdings through exponential regression.
Base Mining Formula
Hourly_Mining_Rate = Base_Rate × Finizen_Bonus × Referral_Bonus × Security_Bonus × Regression_Factor
•	Base_Rate = 0.05 $FIN/hour (decreasing over time)
•	Finizen_Bonus = max(1.0, 2.0 - (Total_Users / 1,000,000))
•	Referral_Bonus = 1 + (Active_Referrals × 0.1)
•	Security_Bonus = KYC_Verified ? 1.2 : 0.8
•	Regression_Factor = e^(-0.001 × User_Total_Holdings)
Mining Phases (Inspired by Pi Network)
Phase 1: Finizen (0 - 100K users)
•	Base Rate: 0.1 $FIN/hour
•	Finizen Bonus: 2.0x
•	Maximum Daily: 4.8 $FIN
Phase 2: Growth (100K - 1M users)
•	Base Rate: 0.05 $FIN/hour
•	Finizen Bonus: 1.5x
•	Maximum Daily: 1.8 $FIN
Phase 3: Maturity (1M - 10M users)
•	Base Rate: 0.025 $FIN/hour
•	Finizen Bonus: 1.2x
•	Maximum Daily: 0.72 $FIN
Phase 4: Stability (10M+ users)
•	Base Rate: 0.01 $FIN/hour
•	Finizen Bonus: 1.0x
•	Maximum Daily: 0.24 $FIN
Exponential Regression Examples
Case Study 1: New User (John)
Initial State:
•	Total Users: 50,000
•	John's Holdings: 0 $FIN
•	Active Referrals: 0
•	KYC Status: Verified
Mining Calculation:
•	Base_Rate = 0.1 $FIN/hour
•	Finizen_Bonus = 2.0 - (50,000 / 1,000,000) = 1.95x
•	Referral_Bonus = 1 + (0 × 0.1) = 1.0x
•	Security_Bonus = 1.2x (KYC verified)
•	Regression_Factor = e^(-0.001 × 0) = 1.0x
Hourly_Mining = 0.1 × 1.95 × 1.0 × 1.2 × 1.0 = 0.234 $FIN/hour Daily Mining = 0.234 × 24 = 5.616 $FIN/day
Case Study 2: Veteran User (Sarah)
Current State:
•	Total Users: 500,000
•	Sarah's Holdings: 10,000 $FIN
•	Active Referrals: 25
•	KYC Status: Verified
Mining Calculation:
•	Base_Rate = 0.05 $FIN/hour
•	Finizen_Bonus = 2.0 - (500,000 / 1,000,000) = 1.5x
•	Referral_Bonus = 1 + (25 × 0.1) = 3.5x
•	Security_Bonus = 1.2x
•	Regression_Factor = e^(-0.001 × 10,000) = e^(-10) ≈ 0.000045x
Hourly_Mining = 0.05 × 1.5 × 3.5 × 1.2 × 0.000045 = 0.000014 $FIN/hour Daily Mining = 0.000014 × 24 = 0.000336 $FIN/day

Smart Contract Architecture
Revised Program Architecture
The Finova Network's on-chain logic is decentralized across several specialized programs, each with a distinct responsibility. This modular architecture enhances security, maintainability, and upgradability.
1. finova-core - The Central Nervous System
This is the primary program that manages all user state and core business logic. It does not hold or mint tokens itself but orchestrates other programs.
Responsibilities:
•	Manages user profiles (UserState), XP (XPState), referrals (ReferralState), and staking data (StakingState)
•	Calculates all rewards and bonuses based on the formulas in the whitepaper
•	Manages active card effects and temporary bonuses
•	Governs the creation of guilds and governance proposals
Key Instructions:
•	initialize(): Sets up the network's global state
•	initialize_user(): Creates a new user's set of state accounts
•	claim_rewards(): Calculates a user's total mining rewards and invokes finova-token to mint them
•	update_xp(): Calculates and adds XP to a user's XPState
•	stake(): Manages a user's stake amount and tier in StakingState
•	use_card(): An endpoint for the finova-nft program to call. Applies temporary bonuses to a user's ActiveEffectsState
2. finova-token - The Minting Utility
This program's sole responsibility is to manage the supply of the FIN token. It is a simple, secure utility controlled by other authorized programs.
Responsibilities:
•	Manages the FIN token mint (fin_mint)
•	Holds the minting authority for the FIN token
Key Instructions:
•	initialize(): Creates the FIN token mint
•	mint_rewards(amount): A permissioned instruction that can only be called by finova-core. It mints the specified amount of tokens and sends them to the user
3. finova-nft - The NFT Engine & Marketplace
This program handles all logic related to NFTs, including special cards.
Responsibilities:
•	Manages NFT creation, metadata, and ownership
•	Implements the full marketplace logic (listing, buying, auctions)
Key Integration Point:
•	use_special_card(): When a user calls this instruction, the finova-nft program makes a CPI to finova-core's use_card instruction. This informs the core program to apply the specific card's bonus effects
4. finova-defi, finova-oracle, finova-bridge - Peripheral Services
These programs have been simplified into mock/stub versions for initial development to reduce risk and complexity.
•	finova-defi: Provides a basic AMM interface. For production, it should be integrated with finova-core by reading state (e.g., XPState) to grant DeFi-related bonuses
•	finova-oracle: A simple mock oracle with an admin-controlled price feed. For production, this must be replaced with a robust, decentralized oracle like Pyth or Switchboard
•	finova-bridge: A simple mock bridge with admin-controlled locking/unlocking. For production, this must be replaced with a secure, audited bridge protocol like Wormhole
________________________________________
Core Interaction Flows
The revised architecture relies on two primary CPI flows:
1. Reward Minting Flow
1.	User calls claim_rewards() on finova-core
2.	finova-core reads UserState, XPState, ReferralState, StakingState, and ActiveEffectsState
3.	finova-core calculates the final reward amount based on all bonuses and multipliers
4.	finova-core (as a PDA signer) calls mint_rewards(amount) on finova-token
5.	finova-token validates that the caller is the authorized finova-core program
6.	finova-token mints the amount of new FIN tokens directly to the user's token account
2. Special Card Usage Flow
1.	User calls use_special_card() on finova-nft
2.	finova-nft validates that the user owns the card NFT
3.	finova-nft determines the card's effects (e.g., +100% mining boost for 24 hours)
4.	finova-nft (as a user-signed instruction) calls use_card(effect_type, multiplier, duration) on finova-core
5.	finova-core validates the call and adds the effect to the user's ActiveEffectsState
6.	finova-nft marks the card NFT as used and burns it
This updated architecture provides a secure and scalable foundation for the Finova Network, properly separating concerns while enabling the complex, interconnected reward system described in the main whitepaper.

Conclusion
Finova Network represents the next evolution of social media monetization, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem where authentic engagement generates measurable value through our integrated XP, RP, and $FIN mining system. By combining proven mechanics from Hamster Kombat's gamification, Pi Network's mining approach, and Ethena's tokenomics, we've created a unique platform that rewards users fairly while preventing abuse through sophisticated exponential regression algorithms.
Our modular smart contract architecture ensures security, scalability, and upgradability while maintaining the complex interconnected reward system that makes Finova unique. The separation of concerns between finova-core, finova-token, and finova-nft programs provides a robust foundation for future expansion and feature development.
Key Innovations
1. Triple Reward Integration: Our XP, RP, and mining systems work synergistically, creating compound value for engaged users while maintaining economic sustainability.
2. Exponential Regression Fairness: Mathematical formulas ensure early adopters are rewarded without preventing new users from earning meaningful rewards, while preventing whale dominance.
3. AI-Powered Quality Assessment: Advanced content analysis ensures rewards go to genuine, high-quality engagement rather than spam or bot activity.
4. Real-World Integration: Seamless e-wallet connectivity bridges the gap between crypto rewards and everyday usability in Indonesia and beyond.
5. Modular Smart Contract Architecture: Security-first design with specialized programs for different functions, enabling secure Cross-Program Invocations and future upgradability.
