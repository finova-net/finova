## Migration Guides

### Upgrading from v3.x to v4.0

**Breaking Changes:**
- Smart contract addresses have changed
- API endpoints restructured
- Authentication flow updated
- Mining algorithm completely rewritten

**Migration Steps:**
1. **Smart Contract Migration**
   ```bash
   # Update contract addresses in your application
   export FINOVA_CORE_ADDRESS="new_core_address"
   export FINOVA_TOKEN_ADDRESS="new_token_address"
   ```

2. **API Migration**
   ```javascript
   // Old API (v3.x)
   GET /api/v3/user/mining-rate
   
   // New API (v4.0)
   GET /api/v4/users/{userId}/mining/current-rate
   ```

3. **SDK Migration**
   ```typescript
   // Old SDK
   import { FinovaClient } from '@finova/sdk-legacy';
